I gain more confidence about setting up CRUD as I repeat the process. It was helpful for me to do 1st run, 2nd run and 3rd and 4th run on different day since repeating 4 times in a row doesn't test me for a long term memory. Now I would like to develop skills for short cut way of setting up basic CRUD, such us creating index, new, edit, update, show and destroy action when I make a controller.
